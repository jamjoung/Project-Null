check out app on heroku: https://projectnull.herokuapp.com/
If you want to use/modify locally everything you need in is the project code folder. You will need nodejs, we used version v14.15.0.
Once downloaded it should contain all modules required but if there is a problem we have a package.json file with all dependancies in All project code folder. 
To try out simply 'cd all project code' in your terminal to get to the proper directory. then run 'node server.js' the server will be locally hosted to port 8080.

note: "All project code" contains all the used code in our build. anything outside the folder is for the class.
